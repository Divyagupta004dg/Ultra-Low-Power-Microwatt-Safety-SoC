ðŸ”“ *In a world where industrial safety and medical reliability depend on ultra-low-power, always-on monitoring, current solutions fail due to high energy consumption, bulky batteries, and limited integration. Our proposed IndusGuard: Microwatt-Powered Safety Chip leverages open-source RISC-V/POWER architecture, energy harvesting, and a fully open RTL-to-GDSII flow to deliver a self-sustained, batteryless SoC for next-generation critical systems. By uniting ChipFoundryâ€™s fabrication ecosystem with Caravel integration, this project **can** proves that India can lead in tapeout-ready, open silicon innovationâ€”making real-world deployment not only possible but urgently necessary.*

# Problem Statement

Industrial environments (chemical plants, mining, oil & gas, manufacturing units) face critical safety challenges such as gas leaks, fire hazards, machinery failures, and worker accidents. Current IoT solutions ***rely on external microcontrollers (e.g., ESP32, STM32) that are high power***, costly, and not purpose-built for safety-critical real-time monitoring.

There is a lack of a dedicated low-power safety SoC that can:

â€¢ Continuously monitor multiple industrial sensors

â€¢ Run in ultra-low power with always-on wake-up logic

â€¢ Be easily programmed in a high-level language (MicroPython)

â€¢ Communicate securely with central monitoring systems.

 *To address these challenges, we propose a Microwatt-powered Industrial IoT Safety SoC that integrates a RISC-V OpenPOWER Microwatt CPU with custom accelerators, a multi-sensor interface, and an ultra-low-power wake-up receiver.*

ðŸ”‘***By fabricating this chip, industries can deploy millions of safety nodes that run for years without battery replacement, enabling a safer, greener, and smarter industrial future.***

# ðŸ“‘ Proposal Summary

This project proposes a universal safety-focused IoT SoC integrating Microwatt with wake-up receivers and multiple sensors for low-power, high-reliability industrial monitoring. It addresses real-world safety problems, aligns with sustainability and Industry 4.0, and showcases open-source hardware innovation.

# Motivation

â€¢ By fabricating a dedicated SoC, we achieve:

   1 Ultra-low power operation (wake-up only on events).

   2 Compact integration of CPU + sensors + safety accelerator.

   3 Reliability & scalability for trillions of sensors in Industry 4.0.

***â€¢ Aligns with sustainability goals and open-source hardware adoption.***
