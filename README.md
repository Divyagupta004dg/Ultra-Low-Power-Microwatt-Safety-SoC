ðŸ”“ *In a world where industrial safety and medical reliability depend on ultra-low-power, always-on monitoring, current solutions fail due to high energy consumption, bulky batteries, and limited integration. Our proposed IndusGuard: Microwatt-Powered Safety Chip leverages open-source RISC-V/POWER architecture, energy harvesting, and a fully open RTL-to-GDSII flow to deliver a self-sustained, batteryless SoC for next-generation critical systems. By uniting ChipFoundryâ€™s fabrication ecosystem with Caravel integration, this project can proves that India can lead in tapeout-ready, open silicon innovationâ€”making real-world deployment not only possible but urgently necessary.*
