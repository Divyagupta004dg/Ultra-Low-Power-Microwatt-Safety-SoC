*IndusGuard: Microwatt-Powered Safety Chip is a batteryless SoC for industrial and medical safety. Current devices waste power, need frequent batteries, and are hard to integrate. IndusGuard uses open-source RISC-V/POWER, energy harvesting, and ChipFoundry–Caravel integration to deliver ultra-low-power, always-on monitoring. It offers a reliable, secure, and cost-effective solution—proving India’s potential in building certifiable, tapeout-ready open chips for continuous protection.*
